Of course, I knew about the Cubans and [James W.] McCord [a security adviser for the committee], who were all picked up at the scene of the crime. Now, ah, you have read here, excerpts out of a conversation with Colson. And, let me say as far as my motive was concerned, and that's the important thing. My motive was, in everything I was saying, or certainly thinking at the time, was not to try to cover up a criminal action, But, to be sure that as far as any slipover, or should I say, “slop-over,” think, would be a better word. Any slop-over in a way that would damage innocent people, or blow it into political proportions . . . it was that that wanted avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" No. Now, let's, let's use the word “cover-up” though in the sense that it had—should be used and should not be used. If a cover-up is for the purpose of covering up criminal activities, it is illegal. If however, a cover-up as you have called it, is for a motive that is not criminal, that is something else again.

You know, it's rather difficult to tell you, four years later, how you felt.\r\n\r\nThe Sherman Adams Problem\r\n\r\nBut I think you'd like to know. Something new. You see, I had been through a, a very difficult period when President Eisenhower had the [Sherman] Adams problem. [Mr. Adams, who was chief of staff in the Eisenhower White House, was forced to resign in 1958 because of allegations of impropriety stemming from his acceptance of gifts from a businessman friend.] And I'll never forget the agony he went through. Here was Adams, a man that had gone through the heart attack with him, a man that had gone through the stroke with him, a man that had gone through the ileitis with him, a man who had been totally selfless, but he was caught up in a web. Guilty? I don't\r\n\r\nI considered Adams then to be an honest man in his heart; he did have some misjudgment, but, in any event finally Eisenhower decided, after months of indecision on it, and he stood up for him in press conferences over and over again, and [James C.] Hagerty [President Eisenhower's press secretary] did: he decided he had to go. You know who did it? I did it. Eisenhower called me in and asked me to talk to Sherm.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the situation I was faced with: Who's going to talk to these men? What can we do about it? Well, first, let me say that I didn't have anybody that could talk to them but me. .I couldn't have [then Vice President Spiro T.] Agnew talk to them, because they didn't get along well with him. Bill Rogers [then Secretary of State] wasn't happy with them either, and so, not having a Vice President or anybody else. And, Haldeman, my chief of staff himself being one involved, the only man that could talk to them was me.\r\n\r\nConversation With Petersen\r\n\r\nNow, when I did talk to then:, it was one of the most, ah, I would say difficult periods, heart-rendering—hard to use the adjectives that are adequate—experiences of my life. I'll never forget when I heard that, on April 15th from Henry Petersen [then Assistant Attorney General, who headed the Justice Department's Watergate inquiry], that they ought to resign and [Richard D.] Kleindienst [former Attorney General] thought they ought to resign, and it took me two weeks . . . I frankly agreed, incidentally, in my own mind that they had to go on the basis of the evidence that had been presented.\r\n\r\nAh, but I didn't tell them that at that point..I went I say, “.1 agreed with it,” I didn't fully reach that conclusion, because I still wanted to give them a chance to survive. I didn't want to have them sacked as Eisenhower sacked Adams, and then have . . . and Adams goes off to New Hampshire and runs a ski lodge and is never prosecuted for anything; sacked because of misjudgment, yes; mistakes, yes; but an illegal act, with an immoral, illegal motive? No. That's what I felt about Adams, and that's the way I felt about these men at that time.\r\n\r\nNow let me tell you what happened. I remembered Henry Petersen coming ir on that Sunday afternoon. He came in off his boat. He apologized for being in his sneakers and pair of blue jeans, and so forth, but it was very important to give me the update on what had . . . the developments that had occurred up to April 15. And, he said . . . he gave me a piece of paper indicating that they had knowledge of Haldeman's participation and the S350,000, and they had knowledge of Ehrlichman's participation in ordering or. . . what they indicated that Ehrlichman had, had, told Hunt to deep . . . told the, ah, [L. Patrick] Gray [then Acting Director of the F.B.I.] to deep-six . . some papers, and so forth and so on. And he said, “Mr. President, these men have got to resign. You've to fire ‘em.”\r\n\r\n‘A Conspiracy to Get You’\r\n\r\nAnd I said to him, I said, “But Henry, I can't fire men simply on the basis of charges; they've got to thave their day in court, they've got to have chance to prove their innocence. I've got to see mole than this, because they claim that they're not guilty.” And Henry Petersen, very uncharacteristically, because he's very respectful—a Democrat, career Civil Service, splendid man—sat back in his chair and he said, “You know, Mr. President, what you've just said, that you can't fire a man simply on the basis of charges that have been made and the fact that they . . . their continued service will be embarrassing to you, you've got to have proof before you do that.” He said: “That speaks very well for you as a man. It doesn't speak well for you as a President.” And, in retrospect, I guess he was right.\r\n\r\nSo, it took me two weeks to work it out, tortuous long sessions. You've got hours and hours of talks with them, which they resisted. We don't need to go through all that agony. And, remember the day at Camp David when they came up. Haldeman came in first, he's standing as he usually does, not a Germantic Nazi storm trooper, but just a decent, respected crew-cut guy. That's the way Haldeman was; splendid man.\r\n\r\nAnd he says, “I disagree with your decision totally.” He said, “1 think it's going to eventually, you're going to live to regret it but I will.”\r\n\r\nEhrlichman then came in. I knew that Ehrlichman was bitter because he felt very strongly he shouldn't resign. Although, he'd even indicated that Haldeman should go and maybe he should stay. And I took Ehrlichman out on the porch at Aspen—you've never been to Aspen, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThat's the Presidential Cabin at Camp David, and it was springtime. The tulips had just come out. I'll never forget, we looked out across—it was one of those gorgeous days when, you know, no clouds were on the mountain. And. I was pretty emotionally wroughtup, and I remember that I could just hardly bring myself to tell Ehrlichman that he had to go because I knew that he was going to resist it.\r\n\r\nI said, “You know, John, when I went to bed last night . . . “ He said, “I hoped.”\r\n\r\nI said, “I hoped, I almost prayed wouldn't wake up this morning.”\r\n\r\nWell, it was an emotional moment. I think there were tears in our eyes, both of us.\r\n\r\nHe said, “Don't say that.” We went back in. They agreed to leave, and so It was late, but I did it. I cut off one arm and then cut off the other arm. Now, I can be faulted, I recognize it. Maybe I defended them too long; maybe I tried to help them too much, but I was concerned about them. I was concerned about their families. I felt that they in their hearts felt they were not guilty. I felt they ought to have a chance at least to prove that they were not guilty, and I didn't want to be in the position of just sawing them off in that way.\r\n\r\nAnd, I suppose you could sum it all up the way one of your British Prime Ministers summed it up, Gladstone, when he said that “the first requirement for a Prime Minister is to be good butcher.” Well, I think the great story as far as summary of Watergate is concerned, I, ah, I did some of the big things rather well.\r\n\r\nI screwed up terribly in what was a little thing and became a big thing. But I still have to admit, I wasn't good butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" Well, what would you express? \r\n"", "" I well remember that when I let Haldeman and Ehrlichman know that they were to resign, that I had Ray Price [a Presidential speech writer] bring in the final draft of the speech that I was to make the next night. And, I said to him, “Ray,” I said, “if you think I ought to resign,” I said, “put that in, too, because I feel responsible.”\r\n\r\nEven though I did not feel that had engaged in these activities consciously, insofar as the knowledge of, or participation in, the break-in; the approval of hush money; the approval of clemency, et ceter\r\n The various charges that have been made.\r\n\r\nWell, he didn't put it in. And I must say that at that time, I seriously considered whether I shouldn't resign. But on the other hand, I feel that I owe it to history to point out that from that time on, April 30th, until I resigned on August 9th, I did some things that were good for this country. We had the second and third summits think one of the major reasons I stayed in office was my concern about keeping the China initiative, the Soviet initiative, the Vietnam fragile peace agreement and the—an added dividend—the first breakthrough in not love, but at least not war in the Mid-East.\r\n\r\nAnd now, coming back to the whole point of, ah, whether I should have resigned then, and how I feel now. Let me say, I, I just didn't make mistakes in this period. I think some of my mistakes that I regret most deeply came with the statements that I made afterwards.\r\n\r\nSome Misleading Statements\r\n\r\nSome of those statements were misleading. I notice, for example, the editor of The Washington Post, the managing editor, Ben Bradlee, wrote a couple or three months ago something to the effect that as far as his newspaper was concerned, he said, “We don't print the truth. We print what we know. We print what people tell us, and this means that we print lies.”\r\n\r\nI would say that the statements that I made afterwards were, on the big issues, true; that I was not involved in the matters that I have spoken to, about—not involved in the break-in; that I did not engage In the, and participate in, or approve the payment of money or the authorization of clemency, which of course were the essential elements of the cover-up. That was true.\r\n\r\nBut the statements were misleading in exaggerating, in that enormous political attack I was under. It was five-front war with a fifth column had a partisan Senate committee staff. We had a partisan Special Prosecutor staff. We had a partisan medi\r\n We had a partisan judiciary committee staff in the fifth column.\r\n\r\nNow under all these circumstances, my reactions in some of the statements and press conferences and so forth after that, I want to say right here and now, I said things that were not true. Most of them were fundamentally true on the big issues, but without going as far as I should have gone,\r\n\r\nand saying perhaps that I had considered other things, but had not done them.\r\n\r\nAnd for all those things I have very deep regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", "" It snowballed. And, it was my fault. I'm not blaming anybody else. I'm simply saying to you that, as far as I'm concerned, I not only regret it; I indicated my own beliefs in this matter when I resigned. People didn't think it was enough to admit mistakes, fine. If they want me to get down and grovel on the floor, no. Never, because 1 don't believe I should.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some friends who say, “Just face them down. There is a conspiracy to get you.” There may have been. I don't know what the CIA had to do. Some of their shenanigans have yet to be told, according to a book I read recently. I don't know what was going on in some Republican, some Democratic circles, as far as the so-called impeachment lobby was concerned. However, I don't go with the idea that there . . that what brought me down was a coup, a conspiracy, et cetera, et cetera, et ceter\r\n\r\n\r\nI brought myself down. I gave ‘em a sword. And they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish. And I guess if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" No. I . . I again, I again respectfully will not quibble with you about\r\n\r\nthe use of the terms. However, before\r\n\r\nusing the term, I think it's very important for me to make clear what I did\r\n\r\nnot do and what I did do. And then\r\n\r\nI will answer your questions quite directly. I did not, in the first place, com\r\n\r\nmit a . . . the crime of obstruction of justice. Because I did not have the motive required for the commission of that crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", "" The lawyers can argue that. I did not commit, in my view, an impeach\r\n\r\nable offense. Now, the House has ruled\r\n\r\noverwhelmingly that I did; of course, that was only an indictment and would\r\n\r\nhave to be tried in the Senate. I might\r\n\r\nhave won. I might have lost. But, even if I'd won in the Senate by a vote or\r\n\r\ntwo, I would have been crippled and\r\n\r\nthe . . . for six months the country couldn't afford having the President in\r\n\r\nthe dock in the United States Senate,\r\n\r\nand there can never be an impeachment in the future in this country without\r\n\r\nvoluntarily impeaching himself. I have impeached myself. That speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" By resigning. That was a voluntary impeachment. And, now what does that\r\n\r\nmean in terms of whether I, ah . .\r\n\r\nyou're wanting me to say that I . participated in an illegal cover-up? No.\r\n\r\nNow, when you come to the period—\r\n\r\nand this is the critical period—that when you come to the period of March\r\n\r\n21st, on, when Dean gave his legal\r\n\r\nopinion, that certain things, actions taken by Haldeman, Erhlichman, Mitch\r\n\r\nell, et cetera, and even by himself,\r\n\r\namounted to a legal cover-up and so forth; then I was in a very different\r\n\r\nposition, and during that period, I will admit that I started acting as lawyer for their defense.\r\n\r\nI will admit that, acting as lawyer for their defense, I was not prosecuting\r\n\r\nthe case. I will admit that during that\r\n\r\nperiod, rather than acting primarily in my role as the chief law enforcement\r\n\r\nofficer in the United States of America\r\n\r\n—or at least with responsibility for the law enforcement, because the Attorney\r\n\r\nGeneral is the chief law enforcement\r\n\r\nofficer—but as the one with the chief responsibility for seeing that the laws\r\n\r\nof the United States are enforced, that I did not meet that responsibility. And to the extent that I did not meet that\r\n\r\nresponsibility, to the extent that within the law, and in some cases going right to the edge of the law in trying to advise Ehrlichman and Haldeman and all the rest as to how best to present their cases—because I thought they were legally innocent—that I came to the edge and, under the circumstances, I would have to say that a reasonable person could call that a cover-up.\r\n\r\nI didn't think of it as a cover-up. I didn't intend it to cover up. Let me say, if I intended to cover up, believe me, I'd have done it. You know how I could have done it? So easily? I could have done it immediately after the election, simply by giving clemency to everybody, and the whole thing would have gone away. I couldn't do that because I said, “Clemency was wrong.”\r\n\r\nBut now we come down to the key point. And let me answer it my own way about, “How dal feel about the American people?” I mean, how, ah, whether I should have resigned earlier, or what I should say to them now. Well, that forces me to rationalize now and give you a carefully prepared and cropped statement. I didn-t expect this question, frankly though, so I'm not going to give you that, but I can tell you this . . . \r\n"", 
"" . . . I can tell you this: I think I said it all, in, in one of those moments that, that you're not thinking. Sometimes you say the things that are really in your heart. When you're thinking in advance, then you say things, you know, that are tailored to the audience. I had a lot of difficult meetings those „last days before I resigned, and the most difficult one and the only one where I broke into tears, frankly, except for that very brief session with Ehrlichman up at Camp David; it was the first time I cried since Eisenhower died. I met with all of my key supporters just a half-hour before going on television.\r\n\r\nFor 25 minutes, we all sat around in the Oval Office; men that I'd come to Congress with, Democrats and Republicans, about half and half, wonderful men. And, at the very end, after saying, “Well, thank you for all your support during these tough years. Thank you for the, ah, particularly for what you've done to help us end the draft, and bring home the P.O.W.'s and have a chance for building a generation of peace, which I could see the, the dream that I had possibly being shattered. And, thank you for your friendship, little acts of friendship over the years, you know, you sort of remember, you know, with a birthday card and\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, you haven't got much more to say, and half the people around the table were crying. [Representative] Les Arends, Illinois, bless him, he was shaking, sobbing, and ah, I get . just can't stand seeing somebody else cry, and that ended it for me. And just, well, I must say, I sort of choked up; started to cry; pushed my chair back, and then I blurted it out, and said: “I'm sorry. I just hope I haven't left you . . . let you down.’\r\n\r\n‘That Said It All’\r\n\r\nWell, when I said, “I just hope haven't let you down,” that said it all. I had. I let down my friends. I let down the country. I let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but think it's all too corrupt and the rest.\r\n\r\nMost of all, I let down an opportunity that I would have had for two and a half more years to proceed on great projects and programs for building lasting peace, which has been my dream, as you know from our first interview in 1968, before I had any . thought I might even win that year. I didn't tell you I didn't think I might win, but I wasn't sure. Yep, I . let the American people down, and have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life. My political We is over. I will never yet, and never again have an opportunity to serve in any official position. Maybe I can give little advice from time to time.\r\n\r\nAnd so, I can only say that in answer to your question, that while technically, I did not commit a crime, an impeachable offense . . . these are legalisms, as far as the handling of this matter is concerned; it was so botched up. I made so many bad judgments. The worst one, mistakes of the heart, rather than the head, as I pointed out. But let me say, a man in that top judge —top job—he's got to have a heart, but his head must always rule his heart.\r\n\r\nQ, This has, ah . . . this has been more—\r\n Been tough for you? [laughter].\r\n\r\n\r\n"",
