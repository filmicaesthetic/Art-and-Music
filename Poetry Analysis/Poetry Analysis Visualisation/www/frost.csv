"c("" Mr. President, to try and review yotir account of Watergate in one program is a daunting task; but we'll press first of all through the sort of factual record and the sequence of events as concisely as we can, to begin ‘ with. But just one brief, preliminary question. Reviewing now, your-conduct over the whole of the Watergate period, with the additional perspective now of three years out of office and so on, do you feel that you ever obstructed justice, or were part of a conspiracy to obstruct justice?\r\n\r\n"", 
"" I'm very happy to do that, because I think the only way really to examine all of these events is on a blow-by-blow account of what occurred. So, beginning with June 20th, then, what did [IL R.] Haldeman [former White House chief of staff] tell you during the I81/2-minute gap?\r\n\r\n\r\n"", "" P. R. offensive and . . . \r\n"", "" . .

You say, “If we didn't know better, we'd have thought the whole thing had been deliberately botched.” Colson tells you, “Bob is pulling it all together. Thus far, I think we've done the right things to date.” And you say, “Ba . . . ah, basic . . .” He says, “Basically, they're all pretty hard-line guys.” Ah, and you say, “You mean, Hunt?” [E. Howard Hunt Jr., a former White House consultant] and, he says ... and you say, “Of course, we're just gonna leave this where it is with the Cubans . . at times, I just stonewall it.” And, you also say, “We gotta have lawyers smart enough to have our people delay.” Now, somewhere you were pretty well informed by that conversation on June\r\n\r\nThanks for reading The Times.\r\nSubscribe to The Times\r\n\r\n"",

And so you knew, in terms of intent and you knew in terms of foreseeable consequence that the result would be that, in fact, criminals would be protected. Hunt and Liddy, who were criminally liable, would be protected. You knew about them.\r\n\r\n‘Get Them to Stop’\r\n\r\nThe whole statement says that “we, we're gonna .” Haldeman says, “We don't want you to go any further on it. Get them to stop.

It's obstruction of justice how, for however long a per)• od, isn't it?\r\n\r\n- And, also, it's no defense to say that the plan failed, that the CIA didn't go along with it, refused to go along with it, that It was transparent.\r\n\r\nI mean, if I try and rob a bank and fail,. that's no defense. I still tried to rob a bank. I would say, you still tried to obstruct justice, and succeeded for that period.

"" But in that case, if that was the first occasion, why did you say, in, ah, such strong terms to Colson, on February the 14th, which is more than a month before, you said to him: “The cover-up is the main ingredient; that's where we gotta cut our losses; my losses are to be cut; the President's loss has gotta be cut on the cover-up deal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n"", "" But, there's one very clear, selfcontained quote, and I read the whole of this conversation of February the 13th, which I don't think's ever been published, but, and there was one very clear quote in it that I thought was—\r\n"",

This fr nnondmic investigation rests unless one of the seven begins to talk.

He said, further, there was sentencing only two days away; Howard Hunt was now demanding a payment of S120,000 for continued silence. And, Dean suggested that the price tag for blackmail could total one million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe period following the meeting on March the 21st, up to April the 30th, when Haldeman and Ehrlichman resigned, is crucial. The President would later claim that he worked to get the truth out during this period. His critics would claim that be continued to cover it up.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the record now, of that [March 21, 1973 conversation with John W. Dean 3d], as I'm sure you've done, in addition to the overall details, which we'll cornelo in a minute. Bearing in mind that a payment probably was set in motion prior to the meeting and was certainly not, completed until late the evening of the meeting, wouldn't you say that the record of the meeting does show that you endorsed, or ratified, what was going on with regard to payment to Hunt?\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" But, when you, we talk about the money, the $120,000 demand that in fact, he got $75,000 on that evening.

I know where it could be gotten.”\r\n\r\n(2) “Your major guy to keep’ under control is Hunt?”\r\n\r\n(3 )'Don't you have to handle Hunt's financial situation?”\r\n\r\n(4) “Let me put it frankly: I won\r\n\r\nI,was trying to contain it politically. And\r\n\r\nthat's a very different motive from the motive of attempting to cover up criminal activities of an individual.’\r\n\r\nder if that doesn't have to be continued?”\r\n\r\n(5) “Get the million bucks, it would seem to me that would be worthwhile.”\r\n\r\n(6) “Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing?”\r\n\r\n(7) “That's worth it, and that's buying time.”\r\n\r\n(8) “We should b uy the time on that, as I pointed out to John.”\r\n\r\n(9) “Hunt has at least got to know this before he's sentenced.”\r\n\r\n(10) “First, you've got the Hunt prob lem, that ought to be handled.”\r\n\r\n(11) “The money can be provided. Mitchell could provide the way to deliver it. That could be done. See what I mean?”\r\n\r\n(12) “But, let's come back to the money.” They were off on something else here, desperate to get away from the money; bored to death with the continual references to the money. “A million dollars and so forth and so on. Let me say that I think you could get that in cash.”\r\n\r\n(13) ‘That's why your immediate thing. . you've got no choice with Hunt but 5120 or whatever it is. Right?”\r\n\r\n(14) “Would you agree that this is a buy-time thing? You'd better damn well get that done, but fast.”\r\n\r\n(15) “Now, who's gonna talk to him?

That would be my reading of it.\r\n\r\nBut the other point to be said is: Here's Dean, talking about his hushmoney for Hunt; talking about blackmail and all of that. I would say that you endorsed to ratify it. But let's leave\r\n\r\nthat on one side—\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" Why didn't you stop it?\r\n\r\n\r\n"", "" But that night, though, the night of the 21st.

I don't care about the people involved in the coverup; it's the stuff after that's dangerous. Dean and other things, and the things that have been done.”\r\n\r\nAnd, you said, as I'm sure you know: “You mean with regard to the defend‘ ants.

"" One of the other things that people\r\n\r\nfind very difficult to take in the Oval Office on March the 21st, is the, is the coaching that you gave Dean and Haldeman on how to deal with the\r\n\r\ngrand jury without getting caught, and saying that, “perjury's a tough rap to prove,” as you'd said earlier, “just be damned sure you say, ‘I don't rememben I can't recall.’ “\r\n\r\nIs that the sort of conversation that ought to have been going on in the ‘ Oval Office, do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" One of the things you repeated many times, but I suppose most memorably or most clearly on August the 15th, 1973. You said:\r\n\r\n“If anyone at the White House or high up in my campaign had been involved in wrongdoing of any kind, wanted the White House to take the lead in making that known. On March the 21st I instructed Dean to write complete report of all that he knew\r\n\r\n• on the entire Watergate matter.”\r\n\r\nNow, when one looks through the record of what had gone on, just before and after March the 21st, on March the 17th, the written statement from Dean, you asked for a “self-serving goddamned statement denying culpability of principal figures.” When he told you that the original Liddy plan had involved bugging, you told him to omit that fact in his document and state it was for, the plan was for totally legal intelligence operation.\r\n\r\nMarch 20th, as I'm sure you know, you said, “You want a complete statement, but make it very incomplete.” On March the 21st, after his revelations to you, you say, “Understand, I don't want to get all that goddamned specific.” And, Ehrlichman and you, when you're talking on the 22d, and he's talking of the Dean report, he says, “And the report says, ‘Nobody was involved.’ “ And, there's several other quotes to that effect. Was that the Dean report that you described? It wasn't the same as what you described on August the 15th was it?\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" But, then you have a discussion in the meeting with Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell, Dean where you're deciding what the policy's going to be: 4” “Is it going to be a hang-out,” i e., is it going to be the whole of the truth? And, in the end; it's decided that it's going to be one of the great phrases of Watergate-'a modified, limited hang-out.” Which is why I sugest the other quotes that I've quoted to you are decisive.\r\n\r\nAnd then Ehrlichman goes on to say, “I'm looking ‘at the future.” And he says, “Now we already know it's modified; limited version of the truth, I.thean it's obviously not going to be the whole of the truth. I am looking\r\n\r\n• at the future. Assuming some corner of this thing comes unstuck at some time, you [that's you] are in a position io say, ‘Look,. that document I've published is a document I relied on, that is the report I relied on.'”\r\n\r\nAnd you respond, “That's right.” Now you've decided tha document's going to be modified. It's going to be limited, and then you're going to rely on that document, and so you're going to be ale to blame it on Dean. And, it seems to me that, that is consistent with all the quotes that I have quoted, and not the open-door quote that you have quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n"", 
"" What I don't understand about March the 21st is that I still don't know why you didn't pick up the phone and tell the cops.
