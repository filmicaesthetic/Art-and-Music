End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
 
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
 
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master
 
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
 
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
 
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
 
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master
 
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master (master)
 
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
 
Fix me
 
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
 
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
 
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master
 
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
 
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
