I caught you cheating
You had the nerve to say you're sleeping
Just not with her, but tell your friends
That I'll be lost without you
And I'll admit it
Sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list so I never forget
All the things I hate about you
 
Ten, you're selfish, nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds, and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic, four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you
 
Your friends must suck if they think you're cool
A sloppy drunk obsessed with his Juul
Keep buying bottles with your daddy's money
And I don't know how I fell for your shit
You gross me out, now I've got the ick
And I've got a list of why you don't get to fuck me
Ten, you're selfish, nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic, four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you
 
You made me love you
You made me love you
Ooh, ah
How'd you make me love you?
 
And I'll admit it
Sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list, yeah
Ten things I hate about you
 
Ten, you're selfish, nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I dated
Seven talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic, four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you
